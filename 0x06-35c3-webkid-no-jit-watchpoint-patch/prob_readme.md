# WebKid

Challenge files for the WebKid (/flag1) and the chaingineering challenge (/flag2).

The patch was tested against commit 5ef29f6546523aa48e18da64735aa164c9bc7de6 of https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/. The binaries were built from that commit.

Check the visit.sh script to see how the server renders your website with the patched WebKit.

See VM/ for the virtual machine setup used on the server. You'll know the password for the VM image when you see it.
